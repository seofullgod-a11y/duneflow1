// Snow spray.
//
// Airborne snow is not a fogged sprite. It is a cloud of ice crystals, and the
// two things that make it read are the two things a plain alpha billboard
// leaves out:
//
//   forward scatter   Looking toward the sun through a puff, it is *brighter*
//                     than the snow behind it and it is warm. Looking down-sun
//                     it is a dim blue-grey. That swing is enormous — well over
//                     a stop — and it is the entire difference between "spray
//                     catching the light" and "grey smoke".
//   shadowing         Spray thrown inside the figure's own shadow must go dark,
//                     or every footfall looks self-illuminated. It reads the
//                     same cascades everything else does.
//
// The billboard is shaded as a sphere: the normal is reconstructed from the
// quad's own coordinates, so a puff has a lit side and a dark side instead of
// being a flat disc.

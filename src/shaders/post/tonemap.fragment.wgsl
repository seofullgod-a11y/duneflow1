// The composite: shafts, bloom, exposure, the display transform, grain.
//
// Everything that has to happen in one place happens here, because each of these
// is defined relative to the one before it. Shafts are radiance and go in before
// exposure; bloom is thresholded in *exposed* units so its knee means something
// fixed; contrast is applied in linear so it pushes into the tone curve's
// shoulder rather than clipping after it; grain goes on after the encode so it
// reads evenly across the range instead of vanishing in the shadows.
//
// Snow renders die at the tonemapper. The scene is a huge, bright, low-contrast
// surface, so any curve that saturates early turns the whole field into a flat
// white sheet with no form — the single most common failure in snow rendering.
//
// AgX is the default here rather than ACES for exactly that reason: it desaturates
// toward white as it approaches the shoulder instead of hue-shifting, and its
// shoulder is long enough that a sunlit drift at 6x middle grey still has legible
// gradation instead of clipping to 1.0. ACES is offered for comparison and does
// visibly worse on this content — it pushes bright snow toward a warm cast and
// crushes the last stop.

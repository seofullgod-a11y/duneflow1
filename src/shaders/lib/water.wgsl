// snowWater — the shape of a bent water body.
//
// Every spell that moves a coherent mass of water is one or more *strands*: a
// swept surface along a spine, exactly the construction the snow-surf wake uses,
// for exactly the same reason. Nothing is generated at runtime; the mesh is a
// static lattice of (column, ring, strand) and the vertex shader places every
// vertex from a small data texture. A ribbon nine metres long and a ribbon two
// metres long cost the same buffer and the same upload.
//
// Two properties this construction exists to produce:
//
//   * an unbroken arc with mass. Bent water is never a sheet of particles — it
//     is a body, with a leading edge, a trailing edge and a thickness you can
//     see through.
//   * momentum. It lags the hand that threw it and keeps going after the hand
//     stops, which falls out of the spine being a *record of where the head has
//     been* rather than a shape recomputed each frame.
//
// Data texture, three rows per strand (strand s occupies rows 3s..3s+2):
//
//   row 0   (x, y, z, radius m)
//   row 1   (rightX, rightY, rightZ, twist)  reference frame, parallel-transported
//   row 2   (distance along m, age 0..1, foam 0..1, flatten)
//
// `flatten` squashes the section vertically, which is what lets one strand be a
// round airborne tube at its head and a wide shallow sheet where it lies over the
// snow, with no second code path.
//
// Per-strand constants arrive as a uniform rather than in the texture, since
// they do not vary along the spine:
//
//   strandParams[s] = (profile, milkiness, alpha, column count)
//
// profile 0 is a closed tube, profile 1 is an open breaking sheet borrowed whole
// from the wake's own section integral — a crescent wave of slush and a carve's
// wall of snow are the same object at different scales, and there is no reason
// for two descriptions of it.

/// Surface relief on the body of the water.

/// Water under this much acceleration is not smooth, and a perfectly smooth tube
/// is the single thing that gives a swept mesh away.
///
/// **The frequencies are in cycles per strand, not per metre.** The lattice
/// carries a fixed number of vertices along the spine and around the section
/// whatever the strand is doing, so what a displacement field is allowed to
/// contain is fixed in *parameter* space too. Keying it to world distance means
/// the frequency in samples depends on how long the strand happens to be, and a
/// six metre column at 13 cells per metre lands at half a sample per cell — far
/// past Nyquist, where the field does not produce fine detail, it produces a
/// beat. Same rule the terrain's `deformHeight` filter enforces against the
/// clipmap lattice, for the same reason.
///
/// Detail above this belongs in the fragment shader, where the sampling rate is
/// the pixel and not the vertex. It is there: two counter-drifting ripple
/// octaves on the normal.
///
/// The balance between the two axes is not free either. Gradient noise sampled
/// with a fast first coordinate and a slow second one is *nearly one-dimensional
/// in the first* — so relief that varies quickly along the spine and slowly
/// around the section produces a ring bulge at every cell, and a tube covered in
/// ring bulges is a string of beads. Water varies far more across a stream than
/// along one, so the section frequencies here are higher than the spine ones.
///
/// **Sampled around a circle, not along `theta`.** A tube is closed: the first
/// and last rings are the same point at theta and theta + 2*PI, and plain 2D
/// noise is not periodic, so feeding the angle in directly gives two different
/// answers there — a hairline crease running the whole length of every tube.
/// Walking a circle through the noise field instead makes the function periodic
/// by construction, the same trick the deformation brush uses for its rim
/// wobble.
///
/// The circle radii set how many features fit around the section: a radius-r
/// circle has a circumference of 2*PI*r noise cells, so 0.85 gives about five
/// and 1.5 about nine — four and a half vertices per feature at the coarse
/// scale, two and a half at the fine. The `u` offset slides the circle through
/// the field, which is what makes the pattern travel along the strand.

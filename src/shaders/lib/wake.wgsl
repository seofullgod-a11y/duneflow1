// snowWake — the shape of the snow-surf wake.
//
// Shared by the beauty pass, the depth pass and the fragment erosion, for the
// same reason `snowDeform` is shared: three copies of a surface definition will
// eventually disagree, and the symptom — a shadow that is not quite the shape of
// the thing casting it — is both subtle and impossible to attribute.
//
// The wake is a swept surface. Its spine is the path the board has taken,
// resampled every ~0.3 m into a small data texture; its cross-section is a
// breaking wave, integrated here from a turning tangent rather than authored as
// a spline, so a single `curl` parameter takes it continuously from a low heaped
// berm to a fully overhanging plunging lip.
//
// Spine texture layout, one column per sample, column 0 = the bow:
//
//   row 0   (x, y, z, distance behind the bow, metres)
//   row 1   (rightX, rightZ, amplitude left, amplitude right)
//   row 2   (curl left, curl right, age 0..1, unused)
//
// Amplitude and curl are resolved per side on the CPU, because which side of the
// board is the *outside* of the turn is a question about the carve, not about
// geometry, and the answer is one number that both sides need.

/// Stop short of ~270 and the tip is still outboard of the crest, which reads
/// as a rounded ridge.

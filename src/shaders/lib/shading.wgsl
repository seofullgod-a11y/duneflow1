// snowShading — the BRDF, the subsurface term, the glints and the shadow filter.
//
// Snow is not a dielectric with a white albedo. It is a densely packed scatterer
// with a mean free path of a few millimetres, which means:
//
//   * light wraps well past the terminator, so shadow edges are soft in a way
//     no amount of shadow-map filtering reproduces;
//   * thin drift edges glow from behind;
//   * shadowed snow is lit almost entirely by the sky, so it goes *blue*, never
//     grey and never black;
//   * individual surface crystals catch the sun as discrete sparkles at grazing
//     angles, and only at grazing angles.
//
// The subsurface term below is doing most of the work of making this read as
// snow at all. If you disable exactly one thing in this file to see what it was
// worth, disable that.
